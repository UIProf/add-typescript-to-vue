# add-typescript-to-vue

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jackkoppa/add-typescript-to-vue.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jackkoppa/add-typescript-to-vue)

## Setup

To run the project locally, clone the repo, install dependencies, and then serve the app
```
git clone https://github.com/jackkoppa/add-typescript-to-vue.git
cd add-typescript-to-vue
npm install
npm run serve
```

And you're all set! The project should now be running at http://localhost:8080/

Note: if you'd rather not use Git, that's fine too. Here's where you can download the current state of the project as a ZIP file: https://github.com/jackkoppa/add-typescript-to-vue/archive/master.zip. From that directory, run the `install` and `serve` commands in your terminal.
